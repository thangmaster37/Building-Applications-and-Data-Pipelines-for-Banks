# Building-Applications-and-Data-Pipelines-for-Banks

## 🚀 1.INTRODUCTION
In this project, I built a website that serves some basic banking functions. My purpose of building this website is mainly to serve the purpose of collecting data to build a data pipeline. In this website, I have integrated some Machine Learning models to serve two problems: Credit Scoring and Fraudulent Transaction Prediction. Building a data pipeline helps me collect data from many sources and store it in a data warehouse to serve data analysis.

## 🧐 2.ABOUT DATA 
The HMEQ dataset reports characteristics and default information for 5,960 home equity loans. A home equity loan is a loan in which the borrower uses the equity value of the home as
collateral. The dataset has the following characteristics:

-**JOB**: job type, including the groups “Office”, “Sales”, “Mananger”, “Professional Executive”, “Self business” and other jobs.
-**YOJ**: Number of years at current job
-**DEROG**: Number of reported defaults.
